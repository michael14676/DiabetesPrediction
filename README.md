# Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains code and documentation for a project focused on predicting diabetes using various statistical learning and machine learning techniques. The aim is to compare model performance while exploring interpretability and feature influence.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Objective:** Predict the presence of diabetes in female patients based on diagnostic measurements.
- **Models Used:**
  - Classical: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression (for exploration), Polynomial Regression, Splines, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
  - Tree-based: Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting

## Highlights

- Comparative analysis of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, and recall
- Application of feature engineering techniques, including polynomial terms and splines
